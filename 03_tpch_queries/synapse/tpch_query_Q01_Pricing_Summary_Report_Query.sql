/*
The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped as of a given date.
The date is within 60 - 120 days of the greatest ship date contained in the database. The query lists totals for
extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended
price, and average discount. These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in
ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each group is
included
